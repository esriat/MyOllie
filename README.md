# MyOllie

## Disclaimer

This project is an Android application that allows you to manipulate an Ollie robot using a Myo armband.

As the Myo armband is no longer sold, documentation and packages/libraries are slowly disapearing. That's why there's a file called "myorepository". Here's the link of the source code : https://github.com/thalmiclabs/RAD-projects/tree/master/MyoWhip. <br/>
I'm not trying to steal the work of the autor. As documentation and libraries are slowly disapearing, and as we depend on this specific repository, we decided to copy it here, so the application will work even if the repository gets deleted.

This application was made during my second year of studies during a school project. The code is not clean, and not optimized. Also, it was only made in a couple of weeks, when I had no idea how Android worked.

## How to use it ?

#### Installing the application

To install the application on your mobile, you'll need to use Android Studio. Simply deploy it on an Android smartphone, and here you go.

#### Using the application : Manipulating the robot

In order to use this application, you'll need Bluetooth. Obviously, you'll also need a ready-to-use Myo armband and an Ollie robot.

First, connect it to your Ollie robot, and then to your Myo armband. Connecting the robot first is better, as connecting to the Myo armband is easier.

Now, you can manipulate the robot by moving your fingers and your hand. There might be errors here, I'll update this file ASAP it it's the case :
- <strong>FIST</strong> : To move the Ollie robot <strong>forward</strong>, in a straight line.
- <strong>SPREAD FINGERS</strong> : To move the robot <strong>backwards</strong> in a straight line. 
- <strong>WAVE RIGHT</strong> : To make the robot turn to the right. Be careful, we will not turn to your right, but to <strong>his</strong> right.
- <strong>WAVE LEFT</strong> : To make the robot turn to the left. Same warning than the "WAVE RIGHT" command.

Note that the Myo armband is capricious. Do not hesitate to exaggerate the movements so that the Myo detects them correctly, or at least, more easily.

#### Using the application : Other functionnalities

On the screen, there are multiple buttons. The first two allow you to connect to the Myo armband and the Ollie robot.

Then, you can change the color of your robot, or set the speed of your robot to 0.2, 0.6 or 1. Be careful, 1 is pretty fast !
